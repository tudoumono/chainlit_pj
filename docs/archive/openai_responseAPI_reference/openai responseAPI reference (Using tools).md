Using tools
===========

Use tools like remote MCP servers or web search to extend the model's capabilities.

When generating model responses, you can extend capabilities using built‑in tools and remote MCP servers. These enable the model to search the web, retrieve from your files, call your own functions, or access third‑party services.

Web search

Include web search results for the model response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    tools: [
        { type: "web_search_preview" },
    ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

File search

Search your files in a response

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools: [
        {
            type: "file_search",
            vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
        },
    ],
});
console.log(response);
```

Function calling

Call your own function

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const tools = [
    {
        type: "function",
        name: "get_weather",
        description: "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        parameters: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
                location: {
                    type: "string",
                    description: "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia",
                },
            },
            required: ["location"],
            additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
    },
];

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    input: [
        { role: "user", content: "What is the weather like in Paris today?" },
    ],
    tools,
});

console.log(response.output[0].to_json());
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia",
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"],
            "additionalProperties": False,
        },
        "strict": True,
    },
]

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"},
    ],
    tools=tools,
)

print(response.output[0].to_json())
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "input": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"}
    ],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Remote MCP

Call a remote MCP server

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": "never"
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?"
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [
        {

            server_label: "deepwiki",
            server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            require_approval: "never",
        },
    ],
    input: "What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "deepwiki",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?",

Usage in the API
----------------

When making a request to generate a [model response](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), you can enable tool access by specifying configurations in the `tools` parameter. Each tool has its own unique configuration requirements—see the [Available tools](/docs/guides/tools#available-tools) section for detailed instructions.

Based on the provided [prompt](/docs/guides/text), the model automatically decides whether to use a configured tool. For instance, if your prompt requests information beyond the model's training cutoff date and web search is enabled, the model will typically invoke the web search tool to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information.

You can explicitly control or guide this behavior by setting the `tool_choice` parameter [in the API request](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

### Function calling

In addition to built-in tools, you can define custom functions using the `tools` array. These custom functions allow the model to call your application's code, enabling access to specific data or capabilities not directly available within the model.

Learn more in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling).
